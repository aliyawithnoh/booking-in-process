3. That's it! No build process or dependencies required.

### Configuring Backend API

The system connects to a backend API for data storage and AI features.

**Quick Setup:**

1. **Start the Example Backend:**
```bash
node backend-example.js
```

2. **Update Configuration:**
In `/config.js`, set:
```javascript
BACKEND_API_URL: 'http://localhost:3000/api'
```

3. **Check Connection:**
- Click the **‚öôÔ∏è** button (bottom right)
- Verify "Backend API: Connected ‚úì"

**Production Setup:**
- See `/BACKEND-SETUP.md` for deployment instructions
- See `/BACKEND-API-SPEC.md` for API specifications
- Use any backend framework (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)

**Note:** The system works without a backend using fallback features, but database storage and advanced AI features will be limited.

```

## Configuration

Edit `config.js` to customize:

- **API Settings** - OpenAI model, temperature, max tokens
- **Room Data** - Add/edit rooms, capacities, rates, amenities
- **Time Slots** - Modify available booking times
- **AI Prompts** - Customize AI behavior and responses

## Data Storage

The system uses **localStorage** for:
- OpenAI API key (encrypted)
- Booking records
- User session data

**Important:** localStorage is browser-specific. Bookings won't sync across different browsers or devices. For production use, implement a backend database.

## Backend API

### Architecture

```
Frontend (Browser) ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Database
                          ‚Üì
                      OpenAI (optional)
```

### Features

1. **Room Suggestions**
   - AI-powered or rule-based recommendations
   - Considers meeting type, capacity, amenities
   - Ranked with detailed explanations

2. **Chat Assistant**
   - Conversational AI support
   - Maintains context
   - Answers booking questions

3. **Question Bot**
   - Quick answers
   - Single-shot responses
   - Fast and efficient

4. **Data Management**
   - Secure database storage
   - Multi-user support
   - Booking validation
   - Conflict detection

### Fallback Mode

When no API key is configured, the system uses **rule-based logic**:
- Capacity matching for room suggestions
- Meeting type to amenities mapping
- Keyword-based chat responses
- Pre-defined answers for common questions

This ensures the system remains functional without AI, though with reduced intelligence.

## Security Notes

- **API Key Storage:** Keys are stored in localStorage (browser local storage)
- **Client-Side Only:** All processing happens in the browser
- **No Server:** This is a demo application with no backend
- **Production Use:** Implement proper authentication, backend API, and secure key management

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+

## Customization

### Adding New Rooms

Edit `config.js`:

```javascript
{
    id: 'new-room-id',
    name: 'New Room Name',
    capacity: 100,
    hourlyRate: 100,
    amenities: ['WiFi', 'Projector', 'AC']
}
```

### Changing Time Slots

Edit `config.js` TIME_SLOTS array:

```javascript
{ id: '11', time: '05:00-06:00', start: '17:00', end: '18:00' }
```

### Modifying AI Behavior

Edit `config.js` AI_CONFIG.SYSTEM_PROMPTS to change how AI responds.
